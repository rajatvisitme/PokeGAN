# Pok√©mon GANs Generator

Welcome to the Pok√©mon GANs Generator repository! In this project, a Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) has been trained to generate new Pok√©mon images using a dataset of Pok√©mon images.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage the power of GANs to generate realistic and novel Pok√©mon images. The GANs architecture consists of a generator network that generates new Pok√©mon images and a discriminator network that distinguishes between real and generated images. By training these networks in an adversarial manner, the generator learns to produce increasingly convincing Pok√©mon images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the GANs network comprises a collection of Pok√©mon images. These images serve as the basis for the generator to learn the underlying patterns and features necessary to generate new Pok√©mon.

## Training the GANs

To train the GANs network and generate new Pok√©mon images, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Make sure the Pok√©mon image dataset is properly organized and accessible. Ensure that the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory.

2. **Configure the Network**: Adjust the hyperparameters and network architecture settings as per your requirements. Experiment with different settings to achieve desired results.

3. **Train the GANs**: Run the training script, which will initiate the training process. The GANs network will iteratively train the generator and discriminator networks till the specified number of epochs.

4. **Generate Pok√©mon Images**: Once the training is complete, you can utilize the trained generator network to generate new Pok√©mon images. Use the provided script and specify the number of images you want to generate.

## Results

Since, the results, have not been satisfying, I'll try again with the newer version 1.1
