# Pok√©mon GANs Generator

Welcome to the Pok√©mon GANs Generator repository! In this project, a Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) has been trained to generate new Pok√©mon images using a dataset of Pok√©mon images.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage the power of GANs to generate realistic and novel Pok√©mon images. The GANs architecture consists of a generator network that generates new Pok√©mon images and a discriminator network that distinguishes between real and generated images. By training these networks in an adversarial manner, the generator learns to produce increasingly convincing Pok√©mon images.
